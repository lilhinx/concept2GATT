# concept2GATT
Swift Package for consuming and interfacing with Concept2 PM5 via CoreBluetooth

This package is an adaptation of the work of jessecurry and paschmann and the Concept2_SDK project. However it has been rearchitectued to only focus on the Bluetooth Low Energy GATT specification and data parsing routines. It leaves all other details to the consumer of the package.
